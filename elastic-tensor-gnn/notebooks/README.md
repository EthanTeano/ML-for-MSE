# EGNN Notebook

This folder contains exploratory notebooks created as part of a
learning-focused reimplementation of a MatTen-style SO(3)-equivariant
graph neural network for elastic tensor prediction.

The notebooks emphasize architectural understanding and symmetry
constraints rather than performance optimization.
